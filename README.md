# pytokr

Very simple, somewhat stoned tokenizer for teaching purposes.

Behaviorally inspired by the early versions of the easyinput 
module; shares with it similar aims. But easyinput has grown 
in ways I find inappropriate for many of my students and now
I want to try now a different road.

## To do: 

- Decide committed names instead of the current provisory
get_tok and get_toks.
- Reformulate the current tests in a form appropriate for 
running unittest.
- Automatize a process that generates a jutge-testable 
source even if jutge does not have pytokr.
